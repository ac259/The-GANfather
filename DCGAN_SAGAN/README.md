# PROJECT 1 
## CSE 676 Deep Learning

## Implementation Notes

This project, I have implemented DCGAN completely. SAGAN implementation is incomplete. The Jupyter notebook contains the GAN with the training. 

Every `1000` iterations I have saved the Generator Model to the drive, to ensure maximum train time - I have seperated the process of calculating FID score.

I am attaching the `python` code which I used to run to generate the images from the generator and then calculate the FID.

## Requirements
The requirements for this project and all dependencies are there in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Files Included
1) best_model.h5
2) Report
3) Model --> json for architecture
4) Requirements
5) DCGAN and Self-Attention jupyter notebook
